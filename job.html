<h1>Summer Job</h1>
<p1> This summer I worked for my father. My dad has his own masonry business. Masonry was a very difficult job; early mornings, high temperatures, no shade, and seemingly endless amounts of strenuous labor. From working this job I have a new found respect for labor workers, as the job does take its' toll on people. I feel my character has strengthened from the high stress and pressure situations the job brings on. My best friend from back home worked along side me, which made the job more tolerable. All-in-all I learned skills and made memories that I will keep with me for a lifetime.
