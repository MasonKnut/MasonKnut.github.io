<h2>Gym</h2>

<p1>My passion for weightlifting started when I was a Sophomore in highschool. I was always a heavier child, and at that point in my life I was ready to change that. I went from weighing 230 pounds my sophomore year, and since then I have lost 70 pounds. Weightlifting is one of those interests that become apart of your life in an irreplaceable matter.

<h3>Horse riding</h3>

<p2> I have been riding horses since I was four-years-old. I showed horses until I was twelve-years-old. MY family owns seven horses. My sister and grandfather got me into riding at a young age. My sister is currently a horse trainer in Groton, CT. I still consistently ride horses and I hope to own my own when I am older.
